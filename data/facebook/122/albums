I scrambled down on to the path.I don't think I could
have done it in cold blood.It was a hundred times more difficult than
getting up.		</al_description>

But I had no time to think of the danger, for another stone
sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge.Halfway
down I slipped, but, by the blessing of God, I landed, torn and
bleeding, upon the path.I took to my heels, did ten miles over the
mountains in the darkness, and a week later I found myself in Florence,
with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me.		</al_description>

"I had only one confidant--my brother Mycroft.I owe you many apologies,
my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought I
was dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so
convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought
that it was true.Several times during the last three years I have taken
up my pen to write to you, but always I feared lest your affectionate
regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray
my secret.		</al_description>
