I scrambled down on to the path.I don't think I could
have done it in cold blood.It was a hundred times more difficult than
getting up.		</al_description>

But I had no time to think of the danger, for another stone
sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge.Halfway
down I slipped, but, by the blessing of God, I landed, torn and
bleeding, upon the path.I took to my heels, did ten miles over the
mountains in the darkness, and a week later I found myself in Florence,
with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me.		</al_description>
