 can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too
stiff.
 And the Gryphon never learnt it.
'

'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.

He was an old crab, HE was.

'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.

d, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.


'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to
change the subject.


'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so
on.
'

'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.


'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:
'because they lessen from day to day.

s was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark.
 'Then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday?'

'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.


'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.


'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone: 'tell her something about the games now.

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes.
 He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice.
 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back.
 At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:--

'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said
Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
(Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and
said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!'

'No, indeed,' said Alice.
 'What sort of a dance is it?'

'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the
sea-shore--'

'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.

'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.


'--you advance twice--'

'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.


'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'

'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.


'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'

'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.


'--as far out to sea as you can--'

'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.
