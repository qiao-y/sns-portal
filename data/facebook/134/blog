can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.

'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter
worse.
 You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
name like an honest man.

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.


'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.

 'Why, you don't even know
what they're about!'

'Read them,' said the King.


The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.
 'Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?' he asked.


'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.

te Rabbit read:--

   'They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
   She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.


   He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

   I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
   They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.


   If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
   He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.


   My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.


   Don't let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.

King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'

'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large
in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting
him,) 'I'll give him sixpence.
 _I_ don't believe there's an atom of
meaning in it.
'

The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an
atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.


'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.
 And yet I don't know,'
he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.

I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the
Knave.


The Knave shook his head sadly.
 'Do I look like it?' he said.
 (Which he
certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.
)

'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of
course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know--'

'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.

 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
 Then again--"BEFORE SHE
HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the
Queen.


'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke.
 (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
it lasted.
