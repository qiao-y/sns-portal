I was seen by the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct
the colonel's attention to my presence.		</p_description>

my sudden return with his crime, and to be terribly alarmed.		</p_description>

that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way AT once, and

same spot for his attack.		</p_description>
