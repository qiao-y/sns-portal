My note to you was absolutely genuine.I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I
perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty
standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety.I read an
inexorable purpose in his gray eyes.		</al_description>

I exchanged some remarks with him,
therefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note
which you afterwards received.I left it with my cigarette-box and my
stick, and I walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels.When
I reached the end I stood at bay.		</al_description>

He drew no weapon, but he rushed at me
and threw his long arms around me.He knew that his own game was up, and
was only anxious to revenge himself upon me.We tottered together upon
the brink of the fall.		</al_description>
