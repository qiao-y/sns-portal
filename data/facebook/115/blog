d you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.


'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.
'

'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.


'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin
without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.
 It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost
wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'

 A Mad Tea-Party

There was a table set out under a tree i		</b_title>
		<b_body>
n front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.
 'Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
suppose it doesn't mind.
'

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice
coming.
 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.


'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

ce looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.

'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.


'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.


'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.


'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said
the March Hare.

 didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great
many more than three.
'

'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.
 He had been looking at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.


'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some
severity; 'it's very rude.
'

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'

'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.

'm glad they've
begun asking riddles.
--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.


'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the
March Hare.


'Exactly so,' said Alice.


'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.

 do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you know.
'

'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter.
 'You might just as well say
that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'

'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I
get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'

'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing
as "I sleep when I breathe"!'

'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
which wasn't much.


The Hatter was the first to break the silence.
 'What day of the month
is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.
