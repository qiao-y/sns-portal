'm mad?' said Alice.


'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.
'

Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how
do you know that you're mad?'

'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad.
 You grant that?'

'I suppose so,' said Alice.


'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
and wags its tail when it's pleased.

 growl when I'm pleased, and
wag my tail when I'm angry.
 Therefore I'm mad.
'

'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.


'Call it what you like,' said the Cat.
 'Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?'

'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited
yet.

d the Cat, and vanished.


Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening.
 While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.


'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat.
 'I'd nearly
forgotten to ask.

in a natural way.


'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.


Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live.
 'I've seen hatters before,' she
said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as
it was in March.
' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
