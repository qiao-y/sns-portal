Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.


'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot.

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
