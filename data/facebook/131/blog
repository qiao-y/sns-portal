 keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of
my own.
 I'm a hatter.
'

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.


'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot.
'

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

s moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her.


'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.
' said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her.
 'I can hardly breathe.
'

'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.

ght to grow here,' said the Dormouse.


'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
too.
'

'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that
ridiculous fashion.
' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
other side of the court.


All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

ve your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or not.
'

'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'

'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.


'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.


'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.
 'Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!'

'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after
that--only the March Hare said--'

'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

'I deny it!' said the March Hare.


'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.
'

'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.


'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'

'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.

'That I		</b_title>

 can't remember,' said the Hatter.


'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.
'

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee.
 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.


'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.

nea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court.
 (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done.
 They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.
)

'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.
 'I've so often read
in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts
at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court," and I never understood what it meant till now.
