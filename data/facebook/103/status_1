down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted
yard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house.		</s_content>

 Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right and we found ourselves
in a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but
faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond.		</s_content>

 Might
I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window,

to surprise you.		</s_content>
