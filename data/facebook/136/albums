Outside the street
was absolutely deserted.Those two men might still be crouching in the
doorway, but I could no longer see them.All was still and dark, save
only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure
outlined upon its centre.		</al_description>

Again in the utter silence I heard that thin,
sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement.An instant
later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and I
felt his warning hand upon my lips.The fingers which clutched me were
quivering.		</al_description>

Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark
street still stretched lonely and motionless before us.But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already
distinguished.A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the
direction of Baker Street, but from the back of the very house in which
we lay concealed.		</al_description>
