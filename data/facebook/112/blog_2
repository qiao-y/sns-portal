 don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.
 While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.
 The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
