shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.
'

'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.
'

'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.


The Hatter shook his head mournfully.
 'Not I!' he replied.

with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

     "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     How I wonder what you're at!"

You know the song, perhaps?'

'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.


'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--

     "Up above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-tray in the sky.

         Twinkle, twinkle--"'

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop.


'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his
head!"'

'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.


'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't
do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.

ght idea came into Alice's head.
 'Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?' she asked.


'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,
and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.
'

'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.


'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.

to ask.


'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.

'I'm getting tired of this.
 I vote the young lady tells us a story.
'

'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

ed.
 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And
they pinched it on both sides at once.


The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.
 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.
'

'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.

'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again
before it's done.
'

'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well--'

'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in
questions of eating and drinking.


'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.


'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd
have been ill.
