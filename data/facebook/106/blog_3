began ordering people about like that!'

in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the looking-glass.

to her lips.

to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
this bottle does.
