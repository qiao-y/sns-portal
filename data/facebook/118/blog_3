This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.


'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an M--'

'Why with an M?' said Alice.


'Why not?' said the March Hare.


Alice was silent.
