A door opened and shut.An instant later steps
crept down the passage--steps which were meant to be silent, but which
reverberated harshly through the empty house.Holmes crouched back
against the wall, and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle
of my revolver.		</al_description>

Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a
man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door.He stood for
an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the
room.He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had
braced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea
of our presence.		</al_description>
