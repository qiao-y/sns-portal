But how did he come by his death? No one could have climbed up to
the window without leaving traces.Suppose a man had fired through the
window, he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a
revolver inflict so deadly a wound.Again, Park Lane is a frequented
thoroughfare; there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house.		</al_description>

No one had heard a shot.And yet there was the dead man and there the
revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will,
and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death.Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further
complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said, young
Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to
remove the money or valuables in the room.		</al_description>
