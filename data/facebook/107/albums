But how did he come by his death? No one could have climbed up to
the window without leaving traces.Suppose a man had fired through the
window, he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a
revolver inflict so deadly a wound.Again, Park Lane is a frequented
thoroughfare; there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house.		</al_description>

No one had heard a shot.And yet there was the dead man and there the
revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will,
and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death.Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further
complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said, young
Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to
remove the money or valuables in the room.		</al_description>

All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon
some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line
of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the
starting-point of every investigation.I confess that I made little
progress.In the evening I strolled across the Park, and found myself
about six o'clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane.		</al_description>
