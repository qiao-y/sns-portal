She had lit a fire there, and
as it smoked she had opened the window.No sound was heard from the room
until eleven-twenty, the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her

room.		</al_description>

The door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to
their cries and knocking.Help was obtained, and the door forced.The
unfortunate young man was found lying near the table.		</al_description>
