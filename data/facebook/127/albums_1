Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking, and my
outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in
ribbons.Holmes's cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me
forward down a long hall, until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the
door.Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right and we found ourselves
in a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but
faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond.		</al_description>

was no lamp near, and the window was thick with dust, so that we could
only just discern each other's figures within.My companion put his hand
upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear."Do you know where we are?" he whispered.		</al_description>
