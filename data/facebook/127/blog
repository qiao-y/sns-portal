'Turn a somersault i		</b_title>

n the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.


'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.


'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at Alice.


'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.


'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.

ndeed,' said Alice.


'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.

'We can do without lobsters, you know.
 Which shall sing?'

'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.
 'I've forgotten the words.

So they began solemnly danci		</b_title>

ng round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

 '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.

 "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.


 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
 They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?

 "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
 But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--
 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.


 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.

 Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

 '"What matters i		</b_title>

t how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.

 "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.

 The further off from England the nearer is to France--
 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.


 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"'

'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song
about the whiting!'

'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,
of course?'

'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself
hastily.


'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've
seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.

'I		</b_title>

 believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.
 'They have their tails in
their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.
'

'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all
wash off in the sea.
 But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.
--'Tell her
about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.
