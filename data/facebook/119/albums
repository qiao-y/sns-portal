In your picturesque
account of the matter, which I read with great interest some months
later, you assert that the wall was sheer.That was not literally
true.A few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some
indication of a ledge.		</al_description>

The cliff is so high that to climb it all was
an obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossible to make my way
along the wet path without leaving some tracks.I might, it is true,
have reversed my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the
sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have
suggested a deception.On the whole, then, it was best that I should
risk the climb.		</al_description>

It was not a pleasant business, Watson.The fall roared
beneath me.I am not a fanciful person, but I give you my word that
I seemed to hear Moriarty's voice screaming at me out of the abyss.		</al_description>
