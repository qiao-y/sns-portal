		<s_content> The famous Smith-Mortimer succession case comes
also within this period, and so does the tracking and arrest of Huret,

crime.</s_content>

		<s_content> It was strange there, in the very depths of the town, with ten
miles of man's handiwork on every side of us, to feel the iron grip of
Nature, and to be conscious that to the huge elemental forces all London
