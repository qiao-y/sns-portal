f that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the
King.


'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.
'

'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.


Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.


'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.

'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
Queen, who was reading the list of singers.


'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.


'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.


'Call the next witness!' said the King.


The next witness was the Duchess's cook.

ed the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.


'Give your evidence,' said the King.


'Shan't,' said the cook.


The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.
'

'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'

'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.

'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.
 'Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!'

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.


'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.
 'Call the next
witness.

n an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,
YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
 It quite makes my forehead
ache!'

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't
got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
 Imagine her surprise, when
the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
name 'Alice!'

CHAPTER XII   Alice's Evidence
'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
she had accidentally upset the week before.


'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die.


'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with
great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.

ce looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.
 She soon got
it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said
to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
one way up as the other.
'

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.


'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.


'Nothing,' said Alice.
