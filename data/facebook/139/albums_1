down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window,
and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as

the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his
foresight.For an instant he was rigid and motionless.		</al_description>

tightened on the trigger.There was a strange, loud whiz and a long,
silvery tinkle of broken glass.At that instant Holmes sprang like a
tiger on to the marksman's back, and hurled him flat upon his face.		</al_description>
