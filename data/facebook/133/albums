That angular shadow up yonder was the bait, and we were the
hunters.In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the
hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us.Holmes was
silent and motionless; but I could tell that he was keenly alert, and
that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by.		</al_description>

It was
a bleak and boisterous night and the wind whistled shrilly down the
long street.Many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in
their coats and cravats.Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen
the same figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared
to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house
some distance up the street.		</al_description>
