His two eyes shone like stars, and his
features were working convulsively.He was an elderly man, with a thin,
projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache.An opera hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress
shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat.		</al_description>

His face was gaunt
and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines.In his hand he carried what
appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave
a metallic clang.Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky
object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud,
sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place.		</al_description>
