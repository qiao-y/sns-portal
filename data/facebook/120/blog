'Get up!' sai		</b_title>

d the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.


'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.
 'You make me giddy.
' And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'

'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'

'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.

'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

d Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near.
 The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.


'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.


'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted
in reply.


'That's right!' shouted the Queen.

ers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.


'Yes!' shouted Alice.


'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.


'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.
 She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

d Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'

'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.
 He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under
sentence of execution.
'

'What for?' said Alice.


'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.


'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity.

 said
"What for?"'

'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.
 Alice gave a little
scream of laughter.
 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone.
 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said--'

'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began.
 Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,
the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves
up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
