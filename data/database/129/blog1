steners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
and said 'That's very curious.
'

'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.


'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.
 'I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now.
 Tell her to
begin.

f he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.


'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the
Gryphon.


'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'
thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.
' However, she
got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:--

  ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
  "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.
"
  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.

'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the
Gryphon.


'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.
'

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.


'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.
