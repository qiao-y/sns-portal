ce noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head.
 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
make me smaller, I suppose.
'

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly.
 As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside.
 The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle.

about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
 I think that will be
the best plan.
'

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.


An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
