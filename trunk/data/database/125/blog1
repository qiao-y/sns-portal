 The master was an old Turtle--we used to call hi		</b_title>

'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.


'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle
angrily: 'really you are very dull!'

'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'
added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.
 At last the Gryphon said
to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'
and he went on in these words:

'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'

'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.


'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.


'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.

'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
as all that.

'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.


'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.
'

'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.


'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.

d the Mock Turtle in
a tone of great relief.
 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.

'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of
the sea.
'

'I couldn't afford to learn it.
' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.
