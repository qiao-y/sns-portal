Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.


'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't
take more.
'

'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take
MORE than nothing.
'

'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself

'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself.
'

'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again.

'

'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.
 However, he consented to
go on.
 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--'

'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.


'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
