ce noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head.
 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
make me smaller, I suppose.
'

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly.
 As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside.
 The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle.
