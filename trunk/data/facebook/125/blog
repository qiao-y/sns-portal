 The master was an old Turtle--we used to call hi		</b_title>

m Tortoise--'

'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.


'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle
angrily: 'really you are very dull!'

'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'
added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.
 At last the Gryphon said
to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'
and he went on in these words:

'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'

'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.


'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.


'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.

The Mock Turtle went on.

'We had the best of educati		</b_title>

ons--in fact, we went to school every day--'

'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
as all that.
'

'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.


'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.
'

'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.


'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.

d the Mock Turtle in
a tone of great relief.
 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.
"'

'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of
the sea.
'

'I couldn't afford to learn it.
' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.

only took the regular course.
'

'What was that?' inquired Alice.


'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle
replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.
'

'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.
 'What is it?'

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.

fying!' it exclaimed.
 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'

'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.
'

'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,
you ARE a simpleton.
'

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'

'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.
'

'What was THAT like?' said Alice.
