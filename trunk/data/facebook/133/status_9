 Hopkins
was for leaving the door of the hut open, but Holmes was of the opinion
that this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger.		</s_content>

 The lock was a
perfectly simple one, and only a strong blade was needed to push it
back.		</s_content>

 Holmes also suggested that we should wait, not inside the hut,
but outside it, among the bushes which grew round the farther window.		</s_content>

In this way we should be able to watch our man if he struck a light, and
see what his object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit.		</s_content>

It was a long and melancholy vigil, and yet brought with it something
of the thrill which the hunter feels when he lies beside the water-pool,
and waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of prey.		</s_content>

 What savage
creature was it which might steal upon us out of the darkness? Was it
a fierce tiger of crime, which could only be taken fighting hard with
flashing fang and claw, or would it prove to be some skulking jackal,
dangerous only to the weak and unguarded?

In absolute silence we crouched amongst the bushes, waiting for whatever
might come.		</s_content>

 At first the steps of a few belated villagers, or the sound
of voices from the village, lightened our vigil, but one by one these
interruptions died away, and an absolute stillness fell upon us, save
for the chimes of the distant church, which told us of the progress of
the night, and for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid
the foliage which roofed us in.		</s_content>

Half-past two had chimed, and it was the darkest hour which precedes
the dawn, when we all started as a low but sharp click came from the
direction of the gate.		</s_content>
