Holmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had
witnessed, but I observed all the morning that he was in his most
thoughtful mood, and he gave me the impression, from his vacant eyes and

one of them, and following his gaze I saw the picture of a regal and

occasionally, without any active interference, to give some hint or
