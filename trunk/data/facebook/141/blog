n: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.
 The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.

'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
the poor animal's feelings.
 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.
'

'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.

 'Would

ke cats if you were me?'

'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry
about it.
 And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
 She is such a dear quiet
thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's
such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried
Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
felt certain it must be really offended.
 'We won't talk about her any
more if you'd rather not.
'

'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail.

f I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'

'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation.
 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He
says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful
tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming
away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went.


So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.
'

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.
 Alice led the
way, and the whole party swam to the shore.

CHAPTER I		</b_title>
		<b_body>
II.
 A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.


The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life.
 Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than
you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
age, there was no more to be said.


At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you
dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
in the middle.

ce kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.


'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know.
 Silence all round, if you please! "William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
 Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria--"'

'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.


'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did
you speak?'

'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.

'I		</b_title>

 thought you did,' said the Mouse.
 '--I proceed.
 "Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"'

'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.


'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what
"it" means.
'

'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the
Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm.
