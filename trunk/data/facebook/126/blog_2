 The Lobster Quadri		</b_title>

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes.
 He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice.
 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back.
 At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:--

'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said
Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
(Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and
said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!'

'No, indeed,' said Alice.
 'What sort of a dance is it?'

'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the
sea-shore--'

'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.
