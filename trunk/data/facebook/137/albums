A door opened and shut.An instant later steps
crept down the passage--steps which were meant to be silent, but which
reverberated harshly through the empty house.Holmes crouched back
against the wall, and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle
of my revolver.		</al_description>

Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a
man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door.He stood for
an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the
room.He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had
braced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea
of our presence.		</al_description>

He passed close beside us, stole over to the window,
and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot.As he sank to
the level of this opening, the light of the street, no longer dimmed by
the dusty glass, fell full upon his face.The man seemed to be beside
himself with excitement.		</al_description>
