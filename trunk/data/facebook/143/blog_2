d the
      mouse to the
       cur, "Such
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.

       "I'll be
        judge, I'll
         be jury,"

         cunning
          old Fury:

          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.
"'

 'What are you
thinking of?'

'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?'

'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.


'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her.
