'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing
nobody in particular.
 'She'd soon fetch it back!'

'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the
Lory.


Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
'Dinah's our cat.
 And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
 Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'
On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
