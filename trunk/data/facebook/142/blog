on is, what did the
archbishop find?'

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown.
 William's conduct at first was moderate.
 But the insolence of his
Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning
to Alice as it spoke.


'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to
dry me at all.
'

'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--'

'Speak English!' said the Eaglet.

 don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.


'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.
'

'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.


'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.
' (And, as
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed it.

rst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact
shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there.
 There was no 'One, two, three, and
away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.
 However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded
round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
of him), while the rest waited in silence.
 At last the Dodo said,
'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.
'

'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.

d the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
 There was exactly one
a-piece all round.


'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.


'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.
 'What else have you got in
your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
