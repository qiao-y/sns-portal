I was able at last to have a
good look at our prisoner.It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned
towards us.With the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a
sensualist below, the man must have started with great capacities for
good or for evil.		</al_description>

But one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes, with
their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and
the threatening, deep-lined brow, without reading Nature's plainest
danger-signals.He took no heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed
upon Holmes's face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were
equally blended."You fiend!" he kept on muttering.		</al_description>
