Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.


'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't
take more.
'

'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take
MORE than nothing.
'

'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

'Who's maki		</b_title>

ng personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.


Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question.
 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, 'It was a treacle-well.
'

'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself.
'

'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again.

dare say there may be ONE.
'

'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.
 However, he consented to
go on.
 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--'

'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.


'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

'I		</b_title>

 want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place
on.
'

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the March Hare.
 The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.


Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: 'But I don't understand.
 Where did they draw the treacle
from?'

'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'

'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.

d the Dormouse; '--well in.
'

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.


'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an M--'

'Why with an M?' said Alice.


'Why not?' said the March Hare.


Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed i		</b_title>
		<b_body>
ts eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with
a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?'

'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't
think--'

'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.


This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.


'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood.
 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
my life!'

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it.
 'That's very curious!' she thought.
