before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.


Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: 'But I don't understand.

from?'

'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'

'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.
