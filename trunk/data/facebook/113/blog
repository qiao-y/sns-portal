t had
a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
like the look of the thing at all.
 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'
she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
tears.


No, there were no tears.
 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'
said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you.
 Mind
now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

ce was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with
this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,
that she looked down into its face in some alarm.
 This time there could
be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.


So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the wood.
 'If it had grown up,' she said
to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.
' And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.

nned when it saw Alice.
 It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.


'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.

'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on.
 'Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'

'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.

'I		</b_title>
		<b_body>
 don't much care where--' said Alice.


'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.


'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.


'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long
enough.
'

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.

'What sort of people li		</b_title>

'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives
a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March
Hare.
 Visit either you like: they're both mad.
'

'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.


'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here.
 I'm mad.
