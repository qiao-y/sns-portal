ce considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.

'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.
 'I told you butter wouldn't suit
the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.


'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.


'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:
'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.

The March Hare took the watch and looked at i		</b_title>

t gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,
you know.

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.
 'What a
funny watch!' she remarked.
 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what o'clock it is!'

'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.
 'Does YOUR watch tell you what
year it is?'

'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.

ch is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.


Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.
 The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
 'I don't quite
understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.


'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook i		</b_title>

eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.
'

'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.


'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'

'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.


'Nor I,' said the March Hare.


Alice sighed wearily.

time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.
'

'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk
about wasting IT.
 It's HIM.
'

'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.


'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.

 dare say you never even spoke to Time!'

'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time
when I learn music.
'

'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.
 'He won't stand beating.

Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
you liked with the clock.
 For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!'

('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.
