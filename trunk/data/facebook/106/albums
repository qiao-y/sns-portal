His head had been
horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but no weapon of any
sort was to be found in the room.On the table lay two banknotes for
ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold, the money
arranged in little piles of varying amount.There were some figures also
upon a sheet of paper, with the names of some club friends opposite
to them, from which it was conjectured that before his death he was
endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards.		</al_description>

A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case
more complex.In the first place, no reason could be given why the
young man should have fastened the door upon the inside.There was the
possibility that the murderer had done this, and had afterwards escaped
by the window.		</al_description>

The drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of
crocuses in full bloom lay beneath.Neither the flowers nor the earth
showed any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there any marks
upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road.Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the
door.		</al_description>
