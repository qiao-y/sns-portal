A
mistake would have been fatal.More than once, as tufts of grass came
out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I
thought that I was gone.But I struggled upward, and at last I reached a
ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I could
lie unseen, in the most perfect comfort.		</al_description>

There I was stretched, when
you, my dear Watson, and all your following were investigating in the
most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death."At last, when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous
conclusions, you departed for the hotel, and I was left alone.I
had imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures, but a very
unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store
for me.		</al_description>

A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me, struck the
path, and bounded over into the chasm.For an instant I thought that
it was an accident, but a moment later, looking up, I saw a man's head
against the darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon
which I was stretched, within a foot of my head.Of course, the meaning
of this was obvious.		</al_description>
