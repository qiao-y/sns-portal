steners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
and said 'That's very curious.
'

'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.


'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.
 'I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now.
 Tell her to
begin.

' He looked at the Gryphon as i		</b_title>

f he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.


'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the
Gryphon.


'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'
thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.
' However, she
got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:--

  ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
  "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.
"
  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.

tions continued as follows
  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.
]

'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the
Gryphon.


'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.
'

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.


'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.

'She can't explai		</b_title>

n it,' said the Gryphon hastily.
 'Go on with the next
verse.
'

'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted.
 'How COULD he turn them
out with his nose, you know?'

'It's the first position in dancing.
' Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

'Go on wi		</b_title>
		<b_body>
th the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it
begins "I passed by his garden.
"'

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--

  'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'

    [later editions continued as follows
  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.

  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
  And concluded the banquet--]

'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle
interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
confusing thing I ever heard!'

'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.


'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went
on.
 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'

'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old
fellow?'

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:--

   'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
   Waiting in a hot tureen!
   Who for such dainties would not stoop?
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

   'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
   Game, or any other dish?
   Who would not give all else for two
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'

'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the
distance.
