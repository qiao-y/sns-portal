ce felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,
you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.
'

'Why?' said the Caterpillar.


Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.


'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.
 'I've something important
to say!'

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

d the Caterpillar.


'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.


'No,' said the Caterpillar.


Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.
 For some
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think
you're changed, do you?'

'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I
used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'

'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.

've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came
different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.


'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.


Alice folded her hands, and began:--

   'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,
    'And your hair has become very white;
   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?'

   'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
    'I feared it might injure the brain;
   But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.
'

   'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
    Pray, what is the reason of that?'

   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    'I kept all my limbs very supple
   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
    Allow me to sell you a couple?'

   'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
    Pray how did you manage to do it?'

   'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.
'

   'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
    What made you so awfully clever?'

   'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
    Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'


'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.

TE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words
have got altered.
'

'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
there was silence for some minutes.


The Caterpillar was the first to speak.


'What size do you want to be?' it asked.


'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know.

 DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.


Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.


'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.


'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'
said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.
'

'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
 And
she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
offended!'

'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.


This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
 In
a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.
 Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.

de of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.


'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.


Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
round, she found this a very difficult question.
 However, at last she
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
of the edge with each hand.


'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
