With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I saw his
curved back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng.My observations of No.427 Park Lane did little to clear up the problem

The house was separated from the street by
a low wall and railing, the whole not more than five feet high.It was
perfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to get into the garden, but
the window was entirely inaccessible, since there was no waterpipe or
anything which could help the most active man to climb it.More puzzled
than ever, I retraced my steps to Kensington.		</al_description>

I had not been in my study
five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to
see me.To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book
collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white
hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under
his right arm."You're surprised to see me, sir," said he, in a strange, croaking
voice.		</al_description>
