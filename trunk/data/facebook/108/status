 "You do not add imagination to your other great qualities,
but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young
man, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to
commit your crime? Would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very

body, and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal?
Confess, Lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.		</s_content>
