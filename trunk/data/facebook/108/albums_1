A group of
loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window,
directed me to the house which I had come to see.A tall, thin man with
coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected of being a plain-clothes
detective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while the others
crowded round to listen to what he said.I got as near him as I could,
but his observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in
some disgust.		</al_description>

As I did so I struck against an elderly, deformed man,
who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books which he was
carrying.I remember that as I picked them up, I observed the title
of one of them, THE ORIGIN OF TREE WORSHIP, and it struck me that the
fellow must be some poor bibliophile, who, either as a trade or as a
hobby, was a collector of obscure volumes.I endeavoured to apologize
for the accident, but it was evident that these books which I had so
unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their
owner.		</al_description>
