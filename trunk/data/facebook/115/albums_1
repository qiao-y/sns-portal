My note to you was absolutely genuine.I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I
perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty
standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety.I read an
inexorable purpose in his gray eyes.		</al_description>

I exchanged some remarks with him,
therefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note
which you afterwards received.I left it with my cigarette-box and my
stick, and I walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels.When
I reached the end I stood at bay.		</al_description>
