lady's story? And now, on the top of this, comes the incident of the
wineglasses.</s_content>

second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the
third glass received the beeswing.</s_content>

"What, then, do you suppose?"

"That only two glasses were used, and that the dregs of both were poured
into a third glass, so as to give the false impression that three people
had been here.</s_content>

		<s_content> But if I have hit
upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon, then in

remarkable, for it can only mean that Lady Brackenstall and her maid
have deliberately lied to us, that not one word of their story is to be
believed, that they have some very strong reason for covering the real
criminal, and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any
help from them.</s_content>

The household at the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return, but
Sherlock Holmes, finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone off to report to
headquarters, took possession of the dining-room, locked the door upon
the inside, and devoted himself for two hours to one of those minute
and laborious investigations which form the solid basis on which his
brilliant edifices of deduction were reared.</s_content>
