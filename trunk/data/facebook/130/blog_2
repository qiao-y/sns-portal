ce could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.
 'A nice
muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.


One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.
 This of course, Alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.
 She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
