executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with
the Gryphon.
 Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage Queen: so she waited.


The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till

nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.
 She
pitied him deeply.
 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his
fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know.
