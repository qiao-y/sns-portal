Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark
street still stretched lonely and motionless before us.But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already
distinguished.A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the
direction of Baker Street, but from the back of the very house in which
we lay concealed.		</al_description>
