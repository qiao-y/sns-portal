It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested,
and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable

 The

in the police investigation, but a good deal was suppressed upon that

 Let me say to that public, which has
shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given
them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man, that they
are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I
should have considered it my first duty to do so, had I not been barred
by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn
upon the third of last month.		</s_content>
