It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had
interested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never
failed to read with care the various problems which came before the
public.And I even attempted, more than once, for my own private
satisfaction, to employ his methods in their solution, though with
indifferent success.There was none, however, which appealed to me like
this tragedy of Ronald Adair.		</al_description>
